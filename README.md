### Calculator (2025)

This project is an interactive graphical calculator programmed in Java using the Processing IDE. It features a custom-designed interface with a numeric keypad, operation buttons, and a live display area. All buttons are created using a custom Button class that handles their visuals, hover effects, and click detection. The calculator supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions such as exponentiation, natural logarithm, square root, factorial, sign toggle, and decimal input. It uses two operands (l and r) with a boolean flag to track which is being edited, while the current value is shown through the dVal display variable. Calculations are handled in the performCalculation() method, which also validates special cases like factorials and logarithms. The interface and display are drawn programmatically, including the stylized title and layered text.

### Historic Computer Systems Interactive Timeline (2025)

This project is an interactive graphical timeline programmed in Java using the Processing IDE which displays information about historic computer systems. It features a programically drawn timeline with layered text and shapes to create a graphically pleasing interface. The application is designed with modularity, featuring two custom methods that draw event boxes and date markers. A boolean flag is used to determine whether the event boxes and date markers are placed above or below the timeline. The event boxes utilize the prebuilt mouseX and mouseY variables to track the user's cursor and create a hitbox that detects whether the user is hovering over them. Detailed descriptions of several computer systems are given once the user hovers over an event box.
