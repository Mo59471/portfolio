### Calculator (2025)


This project is an interactive graphical calculator programmed in Java using the Processing IDE. It features a custom-designed interface with a numeric keypad, operation buttons, and a live display area. All buttons are created using a custom Button class that handles their visuals, hover effects, and click detection. The calculator supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions such as exponentiation, natural logarithm, square root, factorial, sign toggle, and decimal input. It uses two operands (l and r) with a boolean flag to track which is being edited, while the current value is shown through the dVal display variable. Calculations are handled in the performCalculation() method, which also validates special cases like factorials and logarithms. The interface and display are drawn programmatically, including the stylized title and layered text.
